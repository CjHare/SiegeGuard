# SiegeGuard
The SiegeGuard project was the MVP for a MultiParty Authentication (MPA) service by 5th Dimensional Security (5DS). 

Designed to provide a secure way of handling authentication involving multiple parties, 
SiegeGuard was aimed at applications where multiple entities need to authenticate actions or transactions collaboratively. 
An MPA can be particularly useful in scenarios requiring high security and verification, 
such as in financial services, legal agreements, or collaborative platforms.

Specialising on a real-time internal Authorisation Service to help organisations validate suspicious, irreversible, or otherwise high- stakes actions before network actors can successfully execute them.

### MBP Outcome
Despite letters of intent, we were unable to secure mutually agreeable terms with a suitable primary investor.


## A single commit code drop
The single commit of SiegeGuard is due to the project being developed in GitLab (hence the GitLab CI/CI files) and after
wrapping up 5DS, I received permission to open source my efforts.


#### @just_another_developer
A temporary NPM user handled used to publish the services as part of CI/CD toolchain, removed after project wrap up.

The source files imported from the `@just_another_developer` space are all contained locally.
